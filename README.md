# Fresno State Aerospace Engineering Program Proposal

## Vision  
To establish Fresno State as a regional leader in aerospace engineering education, producing graduates with hands‚Äëon skills, theoretical foundations, and experience that align with industry needs and emerging space and aeronautics sectors.

## Mission  
- Educate students in aerodynamics, propulsion, systems engineering, avionics, structural design, and unmanned/crewed aerospace platforms.  
- Foster partnerships with local industry, government, and research labs for internships, co‚Äëops, and research.  
- Advance aerospace innovation through research in UAVs/drones, small satellites, propulsion systems, flight dynamics, and space mission design.  

## Program Structure & Curriculum (Suggested)

| Course Area | Core Courses / Topics |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Fundamentals** | Physics; Calculus; Differential Equations; Statics & Dynamics; Materials Science |
| **Aerospace Core** | Aerodynamics; Propulsion; Flight Mechanics; Aircraft & Spacecraft Structures; Control Systems; Avionics |
| **Systems & Design** | Systems Engineering; Space Mission Design; Thermodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Orbital Mechanics |
| **Laboratories & Project-Based Learning** | Wind tunnel testing; UAV/drone design & flight; Rocketry/sounding rockets; Satellite/CubeSat design; Flight simulation |
| **Electives / Specializations** | Unmanned Aircraft Systems; Spacecraft Systems; Advanced Propulsion; Hypersonics; Aerospace Materials; Space Policy & Ethics |

## Facilities & Resources Needed

- Labs: wind tunnel(s), propulsion test stands, avionics / embedded systems lab, structural testing (fatigue, stress), flight simulator, spacecraft integration/test clean room, UAV/drone test field.  
- Faculty with expertise in aerodynamics, propulsion, avionics, control systems, structural mechanics, orbital mechanics.  
- Collaboration space for design project teams.  
- Funding sources for seed equipment, lab development, scholarships, research grants.

## Potential Industry & Research Partnerships

- Local aerospace & defense companies; drone / UAS firms.  
- NASA centers (e.g., Ames), national labs (like Lawrence Livermore), and private space companies for satellite & launch tech.  
- Government agencies (FAA, DoD) and policy/regulation groups.  
- Internships / co‚Äëop programs for students.

## Outcomes & Metrics

- Graduates with strong technical and hands‚Äëon skills ready for industry or graduate school.  
- Student projects (e.g., UAVs, rockets, small satellites) launched/tested.  
- Research publications and external funding.  
- Industry placement and partnership growth.  
- Accreditation (ABET) to ensure recognized standard.

## Timeline (Example Phases)

1. **Planning & Approval** (Year 1)  
   - Stakeholder consultation; curriculum development; budget & resource planning; hire initial faculty; secure lab space.  

2. **Pilot Phase** (Year 2)  
   - Offer core courses; start lab setup; initial student cohort; small‚Äëscale project work.  

3. **Full Launch** (Year 3‚Äë4)  
   - Full set of courses; capstone design; established labs; research projects; begin industry partnerships & internships.  

4. **Growth & Refinement** (Year 5+)  
   - Expand electives; scale up facilities; pursue accreditation; broaden research; possibly launch a satellite / rocket project.

## Budget Considerations (Rough Estimate)

- Faculty & staff salaries  
- Lab equipment & maintenance  
- Facility renovation / build of lab spaces  
- UAVs, wind tunnels, propulsion test rigs, simulators etc.  
- Student support (scholarships, travel, project materials)  
- Initial seed funding + seeking external grants

# üåï NASA Artemis Program Summary

## Overview
The Artemis program is NASA's flagship effort to return humans to the Moon and eventually establish a sustainable presence there, paving the way for future missions to Mars. The program is named after **Artemis**, the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology.

## Objectives
- Return humans to the Moon, including the first woman and first person of color.
- Develop sustainable lunar exploration by the end of the decade.
- Demonstrate new technologies, capabilities, and business approaches for future missions.
- Prepare for the first human missions to Mars.

## Key Missions

### ‚úÖ Artemis I (Completed)
- **Date:** November 16 ‚Äì December 11, 2022  
- **Type:** Uncrewed test flight  
- **Details:** Successfully sent the Orion spacecraft around the Moon and back, testing systems in deep space.

### üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Artemis II (Upcoming)
- **Target Launch:** April 2026  
- **Type:** Crewed lunar flyby  
- **Details:** First crewed mission using SLS and Orion. Astronauts will orbit the Moon but not land.

### üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Artemis III (Planned)
- **Target Launch:** Mid-2027  
- **Type:** Crewed lunar landing  
- **Details:** Will land astronauts near the lunar South Pole using the SpaceX Starship Human Landing System.

### üèóÔ∏è Artemis IV and Beyond
- **Focus:** Construction of the **Lunar Gateway**, a space station in lunar orbit.  
- **Goal:** Enable more sustainable and longer-term missions to the Moon and prepare for Mars.

## Technology
- **SLS (Space Launch System):** NASA‚Äôs new heavy-lift rocket.
- **Orion:** Deep-space crew capsule.
- **Lunar Gateway:** Planned lunar-orbit space station.
- **SpaceX Starship HLS:** Human landing system for Artemis III and beyond.

## International Partnerships
- Includes contributions from ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), and CSA (Canada), among others.

## Looking Ahead
The Artemis program represents a major step in humankind‚Äôs expansion into deep space. With international cooperation, commercial partners, and sustained investment in technology, it aims to enable a new era of space exploration.
