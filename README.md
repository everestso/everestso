# üöÄ The Wild Story of Jack Parsons and the Origins of JPL

## Who Was Jack Parsons?

Jack Parsons (born Marvel Whiteside Parsons) was a brilliant, self-taught chemist and rocketry pioneer. In the 1930s and 40s, he helped lay the foundations of American space exploration ‚Äî all while living a double life steeped in occultism, fringe science, and rebellion.

- **Co-founder** of what became the **Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**.
- Played a key role in the creation of America‚Äôs **first rocket motor technologies**.
- Never earned a college degree ‚Äî yet transformed theoretical rocketry into practical propulsion.

## The "Suicide Squad"

In the late 1930s, Parsons joined a group of Caltech researchers known as the **Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory**. But they were outsiders ‚Äî nicknamed the **"Suicide Squad"** because their early rocket tests had a tendency to explode.  

Their experiments in the Arroyo Seco (Pasadena) were mocked at first ‚Äî but eventually gained support from the U.S. military as WWII loomed.

## JATO and the Birth of JPL

Parsons and his crew developed the first **Jet-Assisted Take-Off (JATO)** units ‚Äî small rockets strapped to planes to help them launch from short runways. This tech became crucial for military aviation and marked the official **birth of JPL**, now one of NASA‚Äôs premier research facilities.

## Occult Ties and the O.T.O.

Parsons wasn't just into rockets ‚Äî he was a passionate follower of **Aleister Crowley**, the British occultist and founder of **Thelema**. Parsons ran the **Agape Lodge** of the **Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)** in Pasadena, where rituals, magic, and free love flourished.

He believed science and mysticism were deeply connected ‚Äî once writing:
> *‚ÄúThe magical and the scientific are simply two paths to the same truth.‚Äù*

## The Babylon Working and L. Ron Hubbard

In 1946, Parsons performed an infamous occult ritual called **The Babylon Working**, aiming to summon a divine feminine entity into physical form.  

His ritual partner? None other than **L. Ron Hubbard**, who would later found **Scientology**. The two had a bizarre falling-out after Hubbard allegedly absconded with Parsons‚Äô money and girlfriend in a failed yacht-buying venture.

## Expulsion, Blacklisting, and Death

By the late 1940s, Parsons had been **expelled from JPL** due to his occult connections and increasingly erratic behavior. He was **blacklisted from government work** during the early Cold War security scares.

He died in **1952**, at age 37, in a mysterious explosion in his home lab ‚Äî officially ruled an accident, though some suspected suicide or foul play.

## Legacy

Though controversial in life, Parsons was later recognized as a **pioneer of modern rocketry**:

- **JPL honors him as a co-founder**, though his occultism is largely omitted from official history.
- His work paved the way for America‚Äôs space program, from **JATO units** to deep space exploration.
- His life inspired books, documentaries, and the 2018 CBS series *Strange Angel*.
